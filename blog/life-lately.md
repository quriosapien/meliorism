# Life Lately

## 2025

### 2025, Feb 20th

Lately, life has been quite a teacher. I've been getting back into the routine of waking up early, hitting the gym, and taking evening walks.  
I've also been dedicating time to daily learning.

Unfortunately, music has taken a back seat, and I miss it dearly.  
I am posting a lot more on [Twitter(or X)](https://x.com/QurioSapien)

Life's a little less stressed. Not worried of work anymore. I wonder if that could be maintained while working as well.
