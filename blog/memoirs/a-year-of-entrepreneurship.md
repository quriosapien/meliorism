# A year of Entrepreneurship

After years of getting acclimatize with startups and businesses, and working closely with founders,
I grew good enough risk apetite to leave a very well established software engineer job, and get my hands dirty.

---

**tldr;** I build a few things, ran businesses for a while, got my learnings, and it's time to prepare for the next innings.

Being Entrepreneur for more than a year, taught me a lot of things, which I honestly don't know when or if I would have learned.
Learning from youtube (YC, A16Z, Stanford Business etc), [essays of PG](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html), reading case studies etc is a good start for anyone new in this field.
But there's no match to what and how you learn once you build something. Execution prevails all knowledge, readings, and the 148 other ways of procrastination.

---

Now, with no means I claim that I have seen it all.
There's still tons of thousands of things for me to learn.

However, since I have spend a good amount of time amidst building my own company, it's a good time for to relect on the lessons I learned.
So, here are those -

- Execution prevails. Build fast, fail fast, improve faster
- Iteration over Perfection. Anyday
- The first idea, first pitch, first product is rarely going to be the last one!
- Four ounces can move a thousand pounds
- A counter instinct to the previuos one - Alone you can do only a little, together you can reach heights
- You co-founder is most probably alreay on your contact list
