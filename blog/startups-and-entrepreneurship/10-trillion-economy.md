# 10 Trillion Economy

Bharat, is growing at a great pace. Faster than most other economies in the world.
It's not a fluke., but rather a result of a great vision.

For quite some time, we weren't as aspirational as we are today. We are leading in some way or other in various sectors worldwide, for example in fintech, in digital connectivity and mobility, space research, renewable energy.  
But we have caught up a lot. Many of our top political leaders, don't look up just for survival, but are hopeful for best growth.

So, given the direction and velocity with which we are heading, if anything, we are going to be a 10 Trillion economy.

Something worth pondering here would be, how would the Bharat of 10 Trillion GDP would look like.
Which all sectors would be 10x of what it's today?
