# About Kumar Gaurav

## Okay Kumar, so tell me about yourself

Alright! To start with, you can call me Kumar or Gaurav, both works! (Some people go with full name, or initials too...)  
_I am a little too busy in my life to mind any of that..._

Born and brought up in parts of Central India, studied at [RKVV, Bijuri](https://www.google.com/search?q=RKVV+Bijuri), [KV Baikunthpur](https://www.google.com/search?q=KV+Baikunthpur), and then at [DPS Bhilai](https://www.google.com/search?q=DPS+Bhilai). I shifted to and stayed in Delhi before joining [MSRIT (now Ramaiah Institute of Technology) in Bangalore](https://www.msrit.edu/).  
Graduated in 2018, I started working with startups and enjoyed it sooo much, that now I prefer to work with satrtups.  
I am based out of [HSR Layout](/hsr-layout) now and enjoy the vast community of founders and investors here. Made some really good friends here too.

I interned and worked full time briefly as Business Development Executive with a Flipkart funded startup (TinyStep), quickly moving to the Software realm which I enjoy. Worked for 5+ years in capacity of FullStack Software Engineer with startups of various size and scale ([details below](/about-kumar-gaurav.html#software-engineer)).  
I absolutely enjoyed working close to founders.

To harness my new found interest in Entrepreneurship, I left Quizizz in Jan'23 and started building my own company. Lots of learnings, realised what I am good at (_tech, product, analytics_) and what I need to work upon (_cold-communications, sales, marketing, strategies, market-research_).

Recently, I joined [SnapTrude](https://snaptrude.com).

### Software Engineer
