# About Kumar Gaurav

## Okay Kumar, so tell me about yourself

Alright! To start with, you can call me Kumar or Gaurav, both works! (Some people go with full name, or initials too...)  
_Iâ€™m usually too busy with life to care about the details, though!_

Born and raised in Central India, I studied at [RKVV, Bijuri](https://www.google.com/search?q=RKVV+Bijuri), [KV Baikunthpur](https://www.google.com/search?q=KV+Baikunthpur), and later at [DPS Bhilai](https://www.google.com/search?q=DPS+Bhilai). After my school years, I moved to Delhi, before heading to [MSRIT (now Ramaiah Institute of Technology)](https://www.msrit.edu/) in Bangalore for my college education.

I graduated in 2018 and started my career in the startup ecosystem, which I quickly realized I absolutely love. Now, I prefer working with startups in various capacities.
Iâ€™m currently based out of [HSR Layout](/hsr-layout) and enjoy being part of the vibrant community of founders and investors here. I've met some incredible people along the way, and made some great friends too.

My journey started as a Business Development Executive at a Flipkart-funded startup, TinyStep. But soon, I transitioned into the software world, and Iâ€™ve been working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer ever since. It's been an exciting 5+ years with startups of various sizes, which I've found incredibly rewarding. [You can find more about my work as a Software Engineer here](/about-kumar-gaurav.html#software-engineer).
What excites me most is working closely with founders and solving real-world problems with technology.

In January 2023, I left Quizizz to explore my newfound interest in Entrepreneurship. Building my own company has been an intense learning experience. Iâ€™ve discovered what Iâ€™m good at _(tech, product, analytics)_ and where I need to improve _(sales, marketing, strategies, cold communications, market research)_.

Recently, I joined [SnapTrude](https://snaptrude.com), an exciting startup that Iâ€™m thrilled to be a part of.
