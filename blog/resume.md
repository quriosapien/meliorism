## Professional Experience (6 years)

### Technical Entrepreneurship

Harnessing my interest in Entrepreneurship, I started building my own company full time since January 2023

#### Twople

- Twople was a marketplace of activites, events and expereiences for working busy couples who find it exhausting to go through never-ending list of suggestions on social medias and search platforms to find one simple thing to do
<!-- - Business metrics before shutting down operations - -->
- | Business Metrics           |     # |
  | -------------------------- | ----: |
  | Monthly Active Users (MAU) |   500 |
  | Monthly Orders Placed      |   ~40 |
  | Users on waitlist          | 3500+ |

#### Stealth Startup

Twople paved way for a few good pivots. I worked on a couple of those ideas afterwards, including -

- **_Quido_**: OneStop center for afterschool activities for children
- **_BeMyGuest_**: Neighbourly activities in a fun and safe environment.

#### ProspectoAI

- Outbound sales are usually very low efficient means of sales. A ROI of 3-5% conversion would be considered good.
- A good chunk of time by salesperson goes into reaching out to people, usually with a common drafted template, and following up with them.
- We came up with a few tools, Automating and using AI to make this work easier.
- We could cut down the time by almost 50% to reach this ROI.
- Next goal was to be able to increase the ROI, ideally by 2-3% at least.

### Senior Software Engineer

Feb 2021 - Feb 2023

#### Quizizz

- Established experimentation capabilities with the product pricing
- Worked on splitting Quizizz app into micro-services for smooth scaling and development
- Streamlined "Game-Settings" for uniformity and experimentations
