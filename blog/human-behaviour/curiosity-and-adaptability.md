# Curiosity and Adaptability

## Growth Mindset vs. Closed Mindset: The Power of Curiosity and Adaptability

In many of my conversations with people, especially in informal, friendly settings, I've noticed an interesting pattern when it comes to how people react to different scenarios or challenges. It's almost as if there are two distinct ways of thinking, two types of mindsets: the growth mindset and the closed mindset. Understanding these two mindsets can offer valuable insight into how we approach problems, learn from experiences, and grow as individuals.

## The Growth Mindset: Curiosity and Openness

People with a growth mindset tend to be curious about the world around them. When presented with a new situation, they don’t just offer an opinion based on what they already know. Instead, they ask questions: _Why is this happening? What can be done about it? How can we better understand this scenario?_ They approach challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. It’s not about having all the answers right away but being open to discovering solutions along the way.

For example, when discussing a complicated problem, someone with a growth mindset may ask, "What are the underlying causes of this issue? How can we work together to improve it?" They view obstacles as stepping stones, not roadblocks, and they actively seek ways to adapt and improve.

## The Closed Mindset: Sticking to What You Know

On the other hand, people with a closed mindset often stick to what they already believe is true. When faced with a scenario, they tend to make quick judgments based on their existing knowledge, without considering new possibilities or perspectives. For them, their point of view is the final word. They don’t feel the need to explore other angles or challenge their beliefs.

For instance, when discussing the same problem, someone with a closed mindset might say, "I don’t think we need to change anything. This is how it's always been done, and it works just fine." They see little need to question or change, believing that their understanding of the situation is sufficient and unchangeable.

## Hypotheticals: A Test of Mindset

One of the clearest ways to differentiate between these two mindsets is by presenting a hypothetical situation. Let’s say you ask someone, _"What would you do if you were in a car accident on a highway?"_

A person with a growth mindset might think through various ways to respond to the situation: _What should I do first? How can I stay calm? What’s the safest way to handle it?_ They focus on how to handle the unexpected, recognizing that they can always improve their reactions and responses to new situations.

In contrast, someone with a closed mindset might respond with, "Well, I’ve never had an accident, and I’m a good driver. It’s unlikely to happen to me." They deflect the question by focusing on why the situation probably won’t occur, instead of considering how they would deal with it if it did. Their tendency is to reason away potential challenges rather than explore how they might adapt to them.

## The Power of a Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is more than just an attitude; it’s a way of life that embraces challenges and values learning over being right. People with a growth mindset understand that failure is part of the learning process, and they don’t let setbacks stop them from trying again. By approaching life with curiosity and adaptability, they’re able to thrive in ways that those with a closed mindset might miss.

The key takeaway is that we can all benefit from cultivating a growth mindset in our daily lives. It doesn’t mean we have to have all the answers, but it does mean that we’re willing to ask the right questions, learn from our experiences, and remain open to change.

## Shift Towards Growth

In every conversation, scenario, or challenge, we have the choice to engage with an open mind or a closed one. The beauty of a growth mindset is that it’s not fixed—it can be cultivated and strengthened over time. By embracing curiosity, staying open to new perspectives, and being willing to adapt, we give ourselves the tools to navigate through life’s complexities with resilience and understanding.

So, next time you find yourself in a conversation or facing a difficult situation, ask yourself:  
_Am I leaning into curiosity, or am I shutting myself off from new possibilities?_
